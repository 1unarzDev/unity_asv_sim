# Unity ASV Simulator
More information regarding the programming paradigms, available features, etc. coming soon.

Although much of the code has been fully revamped, huge credits to [Edvart's EE thesis](https://github.com/edvart-ros/unity_asv_sim/) for inspiring and acting as a base for this project.
